<h3>Prison Break</h3>
  <p>This is hands down my number one movie series. I love the genius of Michael Scoffield.</p>

<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
  <p>I love Daenerys and her dragons and all of the seasons and its episodes. Peter Dinklage is my favorite character.</p>

<h3>The Big Bang Theory</h3>
  <p>I really love the conversation in this sitcom. The combination of Science and comedy is perfect for me.</p>
